# Project Proposal

Spotify Playlist Builder

# What and why?
Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming platforms, often praised for its playlist functionalities. However, navigating the app and adding songs to a playlist one by one can be exhausting, especially for someone like me, who would make a new playlist even for a grocery trip. The Spotify Playlist Builder (name pending) aims to simplify this process by offering an optimized UI for playlist creation. This tool will also include extra features not available in the main app, making the playlist-building experience on Spotify easier than ever.

# For whom?
This project targets Spotify users who enjoy creating playlists but are dissatisfied with the options available in the main app.

# How?
Users will be greeted by an intuitive user interface that features a playlist staging area, a search bar, and a toolbar for additional functionalities. With a simple drag-and-drop action, users can move song results from the search bar into the playlist staging areaâ€”significantly reducing the number of clicks required in the native Spotify app. The tool will offer several extra functionalities, including:

- An option to add 'n' number of songs based on a music recommendation algorithm.
- A button to remove all songs from a particular artist or album.
- A button to add 'n' random songs from existing playlists or albums.
- Feature to edit existing playlists created by the user.
And much more, time permitting.

When the playlist is completed, it is saved into the user's spotify account. 

# Scope
This project is well-suited for a team of 4-6 programmers. The main focus will be on developing the playlist staging area, a collaborative effort by all team members. From there, the project offers a lot of flexibility. If it turns out to be too ambitious, the number of extra features can be reduced. Conversely, if the project is completed ahead of schedule, there is no shortage of additional functionalities that can be implemented.
